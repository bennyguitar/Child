// Prologue

	It actually irks me that we are using the same film opening sequence that the forefathers of our craft used almost two centuries ago. The countdown from the silent film era is the one odd bit of nostalgia that somehow stuck around. And it could not look more inappropriate for our presentation. The man sitting directly across the slate steel table from me was Dr. Arthur Lang, a double PhD holder in Artificial Intelligence and Music Composition -- who midnighted to get his MBA. He also just so happens to be the CEO of Child, Inc., and we were paid to strategize and roll out their global media campaign. As the lights dimmed and the screen flickered, then beeped from "4" to "3," I could feel Lang's eyes rolling. Mental note: remove that damn opening sequence from everything else we do.

	The "1" eventually wiped away on the screen and a scene began to unfold of the modern kitchen. The prototypical housewife stooped inside of a refrigerator, and tossed ingredients to a humanoid robot. Beethoven's fingers started the soundtrack. The bot had various structures of white glossy plastic for limbs, connected together with black tubing that resembled ligaments and joints. The robot was catching the ingredients perfectly in abstractly human-like hands, and placing them on the counter. Across the room from the oven, the entire wall had been purposed into a screen and it was displaying possible recipe choices then filtering the list immediately as the robot caught each ingredient. Next it fades to white and the word "Child," in a very light gray, slowly fades and rises to the center of the screen. Beethoven's still hammering away as the scene fades back to a robot, head down in the middle of a room while the words "learns while it sleeps" appeared. Then everything fades to a shot of an assembly line as a machine takes the arms off a bland humanoid robot and replaces them with shinier, new ones. The words "free servicing and affordable upgrades" floated up from the bottom this time. The scene faded back to white and "$199/month" was emblazoned in the same light gray. Then the video clicked off.

	I finally exhaled. The commercial had gone off without a hitch; the editing was flawless and professional. I could not tell you how we met the deadline on this one. What a relief.

	"What was that?"

	I looked tentatively at Lang, then my shrugging Art Director -- Michael, then back to Lang and he was already mouthing his next words.

	"You were hired to create an advertisement for Child. What you did with my money instead is anybody's guess."

	"B-but sir," I stammered, "we're proud of this work and think it represents your brand and product strategy in the best light possible. I mean, it showed the Child learning and a shot of your assembly line. Imagine this playing in every home across America." I glanced back at Michael for support, and he skirted all responsibility by sipping gingerly from the paper cup and fiddling with his pencil.

	"You don't understand. This is the future, and you're ruining it." His icy tone cut through the projection computer's hums under the table.

	I started to proclaim, "with all due respect si--"

	"Look," he rubbed his eyes and relaxed his forehead, "get rid of the text that pops up with features. Nobody wants to read about features, they want to see them. Show our audience wiki screens rapidly flashing by and maybe the internal neural network gaining connections with a visualization." He stood up and started pacing, his speech more full of vigor. "It's learning practically at the speed of light - do you understand? While the Child is in Sleep mode, the "brain" begins indexing new wiki pages at random, making lateral connections through natural language modeling into word representations, then categorically into concepts and spatial representations. Each Child is different. Each one solves problems differently than the others because it has a randomly connected set of experiences. You made it look dull, and it's actually one of the most interesting inventions in our corner of the universe."

	We nodded.

	"Show everyone the modularity of the Child by replacing the stock limbs with extended arms and legs. Actually show them the robot getting taller. There is a whole third-party market involved with creating stylish and functional replacements." He stopped, grabbed his coat, and scanned us as we sat dumbfounded by his competence in subtle marketing. "The thing is under a warranty and it stores a copy of its brain every night to the main terminal in the house. If it breaks, you can get a brand new Child and start where are you left off. Are the gears rolling yet gentlemen? If you need to speak with some of our engineers again, it can be arranged."

	Mid-stride through the door he turned and adjourned the meeting, "and please kill the Beethoven. Give me Debussy."

	He was right too. Not a single person, outside of the Child development team, had a clue about what was in store - minus wild speculation of course. The product is practically human - except it didn't get sick and it interconnected with every device in the house. I don't even know why it needs a commercial; the thing is going to change the world. Hey Logan.
