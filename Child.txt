// Prologue

	It actually irks me that we are using the same film opening sequences that the forefathers of our craft used almost two centuries ago. The countdown from the silent film era is the one bit of nostalgia that somehow stuck around. And it could not look more inappropriate for our presentation. The man sitting directly across the slate steel table from me was Dr. Arthur Lang, a double PhD holder in Artificial Intelligence and Music Composition who midnighted to get his MBA. He also just so happens to be the CEO of Child, Inc., and we were paid to strategize and roll out their global media campaign. As the lights dimmed and the screen flickered then beeped from four to three, I could feel Lang's eyes rolling. Mental note: remove that damn opening sequence and start from gray.
