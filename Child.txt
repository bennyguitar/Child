// Prologue

	It actually irks me that we are using the same film opening sequences that the forefathers of our craft used almost two centuries ago. The countdown from the silent film era is the one bit of nostalgia that somehow stuck around. And it could not look more inappropriate for our presentation. The man sitting directly across the slate steel table from me was Dr. Arthur Lang, a double PhD holder in Artificial Intelligence and Music Composition who midnighted to get his MBA. He also just so happens to be the CEO of Child, Inc., and we were paid to strategize and roll out their global media campaign. As the lights dimmed and the screen flickered then beeped from four to three, I could feel Lang's eyes rolling. Mental note: remove that damn opening sequence from everything else we do.

	The one finally wiped away on the screen and a scene began to unfold of the modern kitchen. A woman stooped next to a refrigerator started tossing ingredients to a humanoid robot with various structures of white glossy plastic for limbs, connected together with black tubing that resembled ligaments and joints. The robot was catching the ingredients perfectly and placing them on the counter. Across the room from the oven was a giant screen - the wall was a screen, and the screen was displaying possible recipe choices then filtering the list immediately as Beehtoven blasted and the robot caught each ingredient. Next it fades to white and the word "Child," in a very light gray, slowly fades and rises to the center of the screen. Beethoven's still hammering away as the scene fades back to a robot, head down in the middle of a room while the words "learns while it sleeps" appeared. Then everything fades to a shot of an assembly line as a machine takes the arms off a bland humanoid robot and replaces them with shinier, new ones. The words "free servicing and affordable upgrades" floated up from the bottom this time. The scene faded back to white and "$199/month" was emblazoned in the same light gray, then clicked off.

	I finally exhaled. The video went off without a hitch; the editing was flawless and professional. I could not tell you how we met the deadline on this one.

	"What was that?"

	I looked tentatively at Lang, then my Art Director - Mike, then back to Lang and he was already mouthing his next words.

	"You were hired to create an advertisement for Child. What you did with my money instead is anybody's guess."

	"But sir," I stammered, "we're proud of this work and think it represents your brand in the best light possible." I glanced back at Mike for support and he averted all contact by sipping from the paper cup and fiddling with his pencil.

	"You don't understand. This is the future, and you're ruining it."

	"With all due respect si--," I started to proclaim.

	He cut me off. "Look, get rid of the damn text that pops up with features. Nobody wants to read features, they want to see them. Show them screens flashing by and the internal neural network gaining connections. Show them the modularity of the Child as extended arms and legs replace the stock limbs. Show them the robot getting taller. If you need to get with our engineers, I can make that happen. And get rid of the damn Beethoven. Give me Debussy."
