**// THE CROWDSOURCED NOVEL**

A social experiment, this is the first novel creatively penned via GitHub.

## What is this? ##

This, my friends, is going to be a novel, where the story is created by *you*! I've started everything off by writing a prologue - which can be found in this repository in the **Child.txt** file. This is an experiment in creative collaboration and storytelling to see if an interesting fiction book can be written and created by a community.
